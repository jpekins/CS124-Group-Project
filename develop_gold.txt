Cover two trays with baking paper and leave to one side. In a shallow bowl, mix the brown sugar and pecans.  Cover a pan with aluminuim foil and push down the dumplings, one at a time, and fill them with 1 1/2 tablespoons of caramel.  You can also use a plate to crush the wads. With the help of the aluminium foil, carefully fold the ends and close the edges to assemble empanandas. Keep the dough balls covered so that they don't dry out. Let them cool slightly before serving. Enjoy warm or at room temperature. Let cool completely before storing in an airtight container.  They last for 3-5 days.
