Pass the empanadas through a mix of sugar and pecans and give a slight pat to the sugar that sticks to each side.  Put the pies on the trays. Bake for 20-25 minutes or unitl they become golden-brown. You may have to move the tray from the bottom shelf up to the top and bake for a few minutes after the tray from the top is ready. Caramel will probably drip from the sides while the empanandas are baking.
