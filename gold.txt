Cover two trays with baking paper and leave to one side. In a shallow bowl, mix the brown sugar and pecans.  Cover a pan with aluminuim foil and push down the dumplings, one at a time, and fill them with 1 1/2 tablespoons of caramel.  You can also use a plate to crush the wads. With the help of the aluminium foil, carefully fold the ends and close the edges to assemble empanandas. Keep the dough balls covered so that they don't dry out. Pass the empanadas through a mix of sugar and pecans and give a slight pat to the sugar that sticks to each side.  Put the pies on the trays. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until they become golden-brown. You may have to move the tray from the bottom shelf up to the top and bake for a few minutes after the tray from the top is ready. Caramel will probably drip from the sides while the empanandas are baking.  Let them cool slightly before serving. Enjoy warm or at room temperature. Let cool completely before storing in an airtight container.  They last for 3-5 days.
